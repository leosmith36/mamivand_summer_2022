# 500 nm database

These are the input files for running MOOSE simulations of the Okada et al. spinodal decomposition process. Compared to the 200-nm database, there are two key differences this database possesses:
* This database features 500 x 500 nm images
* This database uses new atomic percents, where Fe-31%Cr-23%Co (wt. %) was converted into atomic percents (so it is now Fe-32.9%Cr-21.6%Co).
