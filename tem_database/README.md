# TEM Database

This database contains TEM images from various journal articles depicting the spinodal decomposition of FeCrCo. The data were subsequently filtered for those which were purely spinodal, i.e., with no applied magnetic field. The data were also filtered for images that looked "clean", as in, looked suitable for serving as a machine learning input.
