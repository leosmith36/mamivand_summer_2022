**Title:** Prediction of Onsager and Gradient Energy Coefficients from Microstructure Images with Machine Learning

**Collaborators:** Leo Smith, Carl Agren, Amir Abbas Kamzedah Farizhandi, Dr. Mahmood Mamivand

In this repo, you can find the files that were used to generate a microstructure image database, extract and filter the images, train a machine learning model, and use the model to predict the parameters of TEM images.
